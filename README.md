Description<br>
------
This is an app built during RIT's Brickhack4 to scrape emails and Twitter to find where free Pizza is on RIT's campus.

We use spaCy 2.0 to perform NER and dependency parsing to figure out if, when and where pizza is being offered
in a given piece of text. The web app is built on Flask.

A lot of this was made during __extreme sleep deprivation__, so the first version (1/29/18) is very dirty.
